Focus On Item App
=================

*The title is very much a work in progress...*

The goal of this project is to build an "App" which focuses on one item of a to-do list, helping people with a short attention span... Oh, hello, squirrels! Which helps people with a short attention span to focus on the task at hand.

the app will be fairly simple, only showing one to-do item in focus. It might or might not allow you to "prepare" said list with other tasks. One day in the extreme far future it might be able to import tasks from other software (once I learn teh codez).

The app will also have a "game" aspect to it, as every item gets assigned 1 - 5 points. The point total is calculated at the end of the day, because it gives a better idea of how productive your day was than "things done" as most to-do items make complete tasks dissapear into oblivion.

This project is in Pre-Alpha phase. Not even the concept is written down. Sad, I know.
